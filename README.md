# CIFAR-10 ML Final Project

This project applies classical machine learning and a CNN baseline on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
It includes:
- Preprocessing with HOG and PCA
- Model training and evaluation (SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- CNN baseline for performance comparison
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Simulated result handling due to resource limitations
